# Dashboard & Clients Demo

This document demonstrates the new Dashboard functionality with tabbed navigation and the Clients management system.

## New Features Added

### 1. Sidebar Navigation

The application now has two main navigation items in the sidebar:
- **Dashboard** - The original document filing tracking functionality
- **Clients** - New client management system

### 2. Clients Tab

The Clients tab provides:
- **Search Functionality** - Search clients by name, email, or phone number
- **Client List** - Table view of all clients with their information
- **Client Details** - View client contact info, document count, and status
- **Actions** - View details and edit client information (buttons ready for future implementation)

### 3. Reorganized Data Structure

- Moved hardcoded clients from `src/features/filing/data/clients.ts` to `src/data/clients.ts`
- Added more sample clients for better demonstration
- Centralized client data for application-wide use

## How to Use

### Accessing the Navigation

1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the main page after login
3. You'll see two navigation items in the left sidebar:
   - **Dashboard** (default)
   - **Clients**

### Using the Clients Section

1. Click on the **Clients** item in the left sidebar
2. Use the search bar to filter clients by:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Phone number
3. View client information in the table:
   - Client avatar (first letter of name)
   - Contact information
   - Document count and verification status
   - Action buttons for future functionality

### Sample Client Data

The system includes 5 sample clients:
- John Smith (3 documents)
- Sarah Johnson (1 document)
- Michael Brown (2 documents)
- Emily Davis (2 documents)
- David Wilson (1 document)

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created

- `src/features/filing/components/Clients.tsx` - Clients table and search functionality

- **Search Filtering** - Real-time search with debounced input
- **Status Indicators** - Visual status badges for document verification

### Future Enhancements

The Clients component is designed to be easily extended with:

- Client detail modal/page

The sidebar navigation can also be extended with additional sections like:
